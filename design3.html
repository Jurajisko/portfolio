                </h1>

                <p>Also speaking of Mark Gurman, here’s his and Debby Wu’s report for Bloomberg on Apple’s AirPods from 6 weeks ago:</p>
            
                <div class="asideline">
                    <p>Apple is still planning to announce high-end, noise-canceling over-ear headphones. The device has faced several development challenges over the past two years and has been delayed multiple times. The headphones were due to go into production weeks ago, but that was pushed back due to problems with the headband, a person familiar with the matter said. That part was deemed too tight in some testing.</p>
                    <p>The company initially wanted to include large touch pads on the sides of the headphones, but reduced the size of those panels.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Reduced them down to nothing, apparently.</p>

                <h1>Gurman on apple's 2021 M-series chip plans 
                    <span> &#9733;</span>
                </h1>

                <p>Speaking of Gurman, I feel like Bloomberg buried the lede on his report this week on Apple’s plans for the next M-series chips, for higher-end MacBooks and Mac desktops. This was the last paragraph in his report, but to me the most interesting:</p>
                
                <div class="asideline">
                    <p>Nunc diam iaculis massa, et aliquet nibh leo non nisl vitae porta lobortis, enim neque fringilla nunc, eget faucibus lacus sem quis nunc suspendisse nec lectus sit amet augue rutrum vulputate ut ut mi. Aenean elementum, mi sit amet porttitor lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet nullam consequat feugiat dolore tempus.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The other stuff was obvious. Of course they’ll just add more high-performance cores to the M-series chips for faster higher-end Macs. They don’t need to make the high-performance cores faster — the M1 Macs already have world-class workstation performance for single core tasks. They just need more of them for multi-core performance.
                    But the big unanswered question is what Apple has in store for graphics. My hunch has been that they’re getting ready to tell AMD to take a hike. (I’m not sure what Bloomberg is referencing regarding “current graphics modules Apple uses from Nvidia and AMD” — the last desktop Mac to ship with Nvidia graphics was <a href="#" class="textlink">the late 2013 iMac,</a> and the last MacBook with Nvidia graphics was <a href="#" class="textlink">the mid-2014 15-inch MBP.</a> Apple and Nvidia divorced five years ago.)
                    With CPUs, we’ve long been looking at the performance of Apple’s A-series iOS device chips and saying, “Hey, these look better than Intel’s x86 CPUs used in PCs.” Apple has shown, for years, that they can make not just great mobile CPUs, but great CPUs period. World-class PC graphics chips, though, would require muscles Apple hasn’t come close to flexing in public yet. 64- and 128-core GPUs would probably do it.</p>
